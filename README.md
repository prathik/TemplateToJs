TemplateToJs
============

Convert your Handlebars/Underscore templates in HTML to Javascript strings.

We generally tend to write Underscore or Handlebars templates in our html document itself but with time and as the number of templates increases, the document becomes exceedingly large.

The advantage of writing it in the document itself is that it is much easier to quickly write the HTML template in a HTML document rather than write it as a Javascript string. TemplateToJs solves this problem by allowing you to convert the templates that are written in the HTML document to Javascript strings when you are using it in production.
